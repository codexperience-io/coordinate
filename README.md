# Coordinate

**Coordinate** is a lightweight library that allows you to write scalable and highly maintainable iOS apps.

It implements the _Coordinator Pattern_ and a few other concepts to help you build apps with a structure that is very easy to understand, with great separation of concerns, a clear navigation flow and encapsulated objects so that you can spend more time implementing cool features and less time refactoring.

You only need to use **Coordinate** with standard UIKit, without the need of frameworks/libraries that introduce too much abstraction in your code.
But because it is a simple library, you can actually combine with frameworks/libraries of your preference and progressively introduce it in your code.

### Installation

**Coordinate** is available with CocoaPods:

```
pod 'Coordinate', 	:git => 'https://github.com/codexperience-io/coordinate.git'
```

More details on the [installation](../installation) page.

### Coordinate Example App

Although we try our best to make **Coordinate** as self-explanatory as possible, we made an example app that covers some common use cases and which source code you can use to play around and follow along as you read on.

The [Coordinate Example App](https://github.com/codexperience-io/coordinate-example-app) is available on GitHub.

### Documentation 

We have put together learning material that we think will help you understand **Coordinate** and quickly start using it.
